# Use extension to differentiate between file types. spro = simple, cpro = complex, dpro = design complex pro 









# Save of a dpro file result in genration of 2 files -> .dpro(abstract info) and .bpro(full information for load view)

#bpro will have explorer of simple fields (if array then also need to see how to set)
#temp file will have all information so that user can modify from tmp file itself. Use delimiters to provide all info.
#cpro view have explorer of simple xml + value also editable. 
#cpro what about structure inside a structure. i.e cpro inside a cpro.


#utils auto add #define , prefix , just take  name and value and create macros with proper alignment.
#auto matic generate word file for all function prototypes with tabular view. Or just use doxygen.
